Since building a high-quality portfolio is a complex task, you cannot paste one giant prompt and expect the whole site to appear instantly. Copilot works best when you give it Context first, then ask for specific Implementation Steps.

Here is the comprehensive 3-Step Strategy to get GitHub Copilot to build your site exactly how you want it.

Step 1: Set the Context (Paste this into Copilot Chat first)

This prompt "trains" Copilot on your specific identity and the design system before it writes a single line of code.

PROMPT 1: CONTEXT SETTING

"I am Prabath Wijethilaka, a final-year Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa. I specialize in FPGA Design, RISC-V, and Hardware Acceleration.

We are building a 'Next Level' professional portfolio using Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

Design Requirements:

Theme: Deep, professional engineering aesthetic. Dark Mode (default) and Light Mode.

Layout: A 'Bento Grid' style landing page (modular, grid-based tiles).

Navigation: Tabs for [Home, Projects, CV, News, Achievements].

Projects: Categorized by [FPGA/RTL, IoT/Embedded, Software, AI/ML].

CV: A digital timeline view of my resume + PDF download.

My Key Data points (from my CV):

Internship: Hardware Accelerated Systems Engineer at LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group).

Top Project: 'SLMs on Edge' (FPGA Accelerator for Qwen3 SLM Inference).

Awards: Runners-up DVCon India 2025, Winner SLIoT Challenge 2023.

Please acknowledge you understand the stack and the persona. Do not write code yet."

Step 2: Generate the Data Layer (The "Brain")

Instead of hardcoding text, we will ask Copilot to create structured JSON files from your LaTeX CV. This makes the site easy to update later.

PROMPT 2: DATA STRUCTURE GENERATION

"I have a LaTeX CV. I need you to convert the content from this LaTeX code into two TypeScript data files: src/data/cv.ts and src/data/projects.ts.

Requirements:

Use the LaTeX content provided below to fill the data.

For cv.ts, structure it with interfaces for: education, experience (with bullet points), awards, and skills.

For projects.ts, structure it with: id, title, category (FPGA/RTL, IoT, etc.), techStack (array of strings), summary, githubLink, and featured (boolean).

Mark 'SLMs on Edge', 'CNN Accelerator', and 'Hydrolink' as featured: true.

Step 3: The "Builder" Prompt (The Code)

Now that Copilot knows WHO you are and WHERE the data is, ask it to build the UI components. You may need to run this in parts.

PROMPT 3: SCAFFOLDING & UI IMPLEMENTATION

"Now, let's implement the UI components. Please guide me step-by-step:

Step A: Global Layout Create a Navbar component that supports next-themes for Dark/Light toggling. It should use a glassmorphism effect (backdrop-blur).

Step B: The Bento Grid (Landing Page) Create app/page.tsx. Use CSS Grid to create a Bento layout.

Tile 1 (Large): Display the 'SLMs on Edge' project from projects.ts. Make it interactive (hover scale).

Tile 2 (Medium): Display the latest Achievement (DVCon India).

Tile 3 (Medium): Display the LSEG Internship role.

Tile 4 (Small): A Link to the CV page. Use framer-motion to animate these tiles appearing on load (staggered fade-in).

Step C: The Projects Page Create app/projects/page.tsx.

Implement a Filter Tab system (All, FPGA, IoT, Software).

Map through projects.ts.

Create a ProjectCard component that displays the Title, Category pill, Tech Stack pills, and a GitHub icon link.

Step D: The CV Page Create app/cv/page.tsx.

Render the experience data from cv.ts as a vertical timeline (line on the left, dots for items).

Add a prominent 'Download PDF' button at the top.

Please start by giving me the code for Step A and Step B."

How to Execute This

Initialize your project first:

Bash
npx create-next-app@latest portfolio --typescript --tailwind --eslint
cd portfolio
npm install framer-motion next-themes react-icons clsx tailwind-merge
Open the folder in VS Code.

Open GitHub Copilot Chat.

Paste Step 1 (Context).

Paste Step 2 (Data) + Your LaTeX.

Paste Step 3 (Builder).

This ensures Copilot doesn't hallucinate generic info but uses your actual engineering achievements.
